# crystal-pg
A native, non-blocking Postgres driver for Crystal

[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/will/crystal-pg/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/will/crystal-pg/tree/master)


## usage

This driver now uses the `crystal-db` project. Documentation on connecting,
querying, etc, can be found at:

* https://crystal-lang.org/docs/database/
* https://crystal-lang.org/docs/database/connection_pool.html

### shards

Add this to your `shard.yml` and run `shards install`

``` yml
dependencies:
  pg:
    github: will/crystal-pg
```

### Listen/Notify

There are two ways to listen for notifications. For docs on `NOTIFY`, please
read <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-notify.html>.

1. Any connection can be given a callback to run on notifications. However they
   are only received when other traffic is going on.
2. A special listen-only connection can be established for instant notification
   processing with `PG.connect_listen`.

``` crystal
# see full example in examples/listen_notify.cr
PG.connect_listen("postgres:///", "a", "b") do |n| # connect and  listen on "a" and "b"
  puts "    got: #{n.payload} on #{n.channel}"     # print notifications as they come in
end
```

### Arrays

Crystal-pg supports several popular array types. If you only need a 1
dimensional array, you can cast down to the appropriate Crystal type:

``` crystal
PG_DB.query_one("select ARRAY[1, null, 3]", &.read(Array(Int32?))
# => [1, nil, 3]

PG_DB.query_one("select '{hello, world}'::text[]", &.read(Array(String))
# => ["hello", "world"]
```

### Error Handling
It is possible to catch errors and notifications and pass them along to Crystal for further handling.
```Crystal
DB.connect("postgres:///") do |cnn|
  # Capture and print all exceptions
  cnn.on_notice { |x| puts "pgSQL #{x}" }

  # A function that raises exceptions
  cnn.exec(
    <<-SQL
      CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION foo(IN str TEXT)
        RETURNS VOID
        LANGUAGE 'plpgsql'
        AS $$
          BEGIN
            IF str = 'yes' THEN
                    RAISE NOTICE 'Glad we agree!';
            ELSE
              RAISE EXCEPTION 'You know nothing John Snow!';
            END IF;
          END;
        $$;
    SQL
  )

  # Notice handling example
  cnn.exec(
    <<-SQL
      SELECT foo('yes');
    SQL
  )
  # => pgSQL NOTICE: Glad we agree!

  # Exception handling example
  cnn.exec(
    <<-SQL
      SELECT foo('no');
    SQL
  )
  # => pgSQL ERROR: You know nothing John Snow!
  #    Unhandled exception: You know nothing John Snow! (PQ::PQError)

```

## Requirements

Crystal-pg is [regularly tested on](https://circleci.com/gh/will/crystal-pg)
the Postgres versions the [Postgres project itself supports](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).
Since it uses protocol version 3, older versions probably also work but are not guaranteed.

## Supported Datatypes

- text
- boolean
- int8, int4, int2
- float4, float8
- timestamptz, date, timestamp (but no one should use ts when tstz exists!)
- json and jsonb
- uuid
- bytea
- numeric/decimal (1)
- varchar
- regtype
- geo types: point, box, path, lseg, polygon, circle, line
- array types: int8, int4, int2, float8, float4, bool, text, numeric, timestamptz, date, timestamp
- range: int4range, int8range, daterange, tsrange, tstzrange, numrange
- interval (2)

1: A note on numeric: In Postgres this type has arbitrary precision. In this
    driver, it is represented as a `PG::Numeric` which retains all precision, but
    if you need to do any math on it, you will probably need to cast it to a
    float first. If you need true arbitrary precision, you can optionally
    require `pg_ext/big_rational` which adds `#to_big_r`, but requires that you
    have LibGMP installed.

2: A note on interval: A Postgres interval can not be directly mapped to a built
    in Crystal datatype. Therfore we provide a `PG::Interval` type that can be converted to
    `Time::Span` and `Time::MonthSpan`.

# Authentication Methods

By default this driver will accept `scram-sha-256` and `md5`, as well as
`trust`. However `cleartext` is disabled by default. You can control exactly
which auth methods the client will accept by passing in a comma separated list
to the `auth_methods` parameter, for example

``` crystal
 DB.open("postgres://example.com/dbname?auth_methods=cleartext,md5,scram-sha-256")
```

**DO NOT TURN `cleartext` ON UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED IT!** Mearly by having
this option enabled exposes a postgres client to downgrade man-in-the-middle
attacks, even if the server is configured to not support cleartext. Even if you
use TLS, you are not safe unless you are fully verifying the server's cert, as
the attacker can terminate TLS and re-negotiate a connection with the server.


```
client                     attacker                     server
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to connect \
                   \->  intercepts, forwards
                        I want to connect \
                                           \----->  receives connection request

                                                  / I support scram and/or md5 only
                        intercepts, sends      <-/
                     /  I only support cleartext
receives attacker <-/
claiming server
only supports cleartext
sends password because
cleartext enabled \
                   \->  receives clear password,
                        negotiates scram/md5
                        with real server      \
                                               \--> accepts scram/md5 auth

```

It is a mistake for any driver to support cleartext by default, and it's a
mistake that postgres continues to have this as an option at all.
