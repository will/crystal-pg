v?.?.?     upcoming
=====================

v0.26.0    2022-01-27
=====================
* Update crystal-db to 0.11. This requires Crystal 1.0.0 or later.
* Drop official support for all 9.x versions.

v0.25.0    2022-01-27
=====================
* Add defense-in-depth for CVE-2021-23222
* Add scram-sha-256-plus "scram with channel binding". If your version of
  postgres does support this, you should provide only this as your
  `auth_methods` in order to exclude the non-plus/non-channel-binding version
  of scram, as it's possible for a MITM to downgrade if the non-plus version is
  on the list. However this driver can't remove support for the non-plus version
  since not all supported versions of postgres support channel binding.
* Give a name to error notice field V (the same as S/severity but not localized)
* Add support for decoding arrays of UUIDs (thanks @jwoertink)
* Allow socket connections to have paramaters from URIs (thanks @grepsedawk)
* Allow blocking connections to PG.connect_listen
* Properly encode null values in arrays (thanks @robcole and @grepsedawk) 

v0.24.0    2021-07-21
=====================
* Decode json columns as JSON::PullParser instead of JSON::Any (thanks @matthewmcgarvey)

v0.23.2    2021-03-27
=====================
* Greatly reduce CPU consumption while reading result sets (thanks @jgaskins)

v0.23.1    2021-01-30
=====================
* update for Crystal 0.36.0 (thanks @bcardiff)

v0.23.0    2021-01-12
=====================
* (breaking) Numeric#to_f for NaN now returns a NaN float instead of 0.0
* add auth_methods config setting to control which methods the client can
  accpet. Defaults to `scram-sha-256` and `md5`. Also optionally adds support
  for `cleartext`, but it is not on by default as simply having this on can let
  MITM attackers steal your password. (thanks @straight-shoota)
* add support for decoding interval type (thanks @pascalbetz)
* Postgres 13 is now officially supported and tested on CI and Postgres 9.4
  support has ended, though as the postgres protocol itself hasn't changed,
  it still probably works.
* Fix overflow for Numeric#to_f for numerics with many digits. This change
  potentially introduces more floating point errors. If you require full
  precision use the optional big rational conversion instead.
* Read Slice(UInt8) as String if given as type. This allows text datayptes with
  unstable OIDs such as citext to be more easliy used. (thanks @matthewmcgarvey)
* Add UUIDs to array decoders (thanks @jwoertink)
